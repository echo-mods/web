Developers of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.2: Old Concept got in touch and talked about some details of the project.The X-Ray 2.0 game engine code was fully transferred to the Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2022 development environment, which significantly simplified the work on the code and allowed us to integrate new technologies.

Animation of characters is created using inverse kinematics and other important technologies, which should provide believable movements.The work is carried out over the facial animations.
