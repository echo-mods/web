# Greetings S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fans!

### *Let's start with this*: the website and desktop app were entirely written by ***one person***.

That person is in fact the same person who is writing this post.

---

### I would like to encourage anyone with the knowledge to help out the projec to do so!

- The website is written in Vue 3 + Nuxt 3 + TypeScript.
- The desktop app is written in Vue 3 + Electron.

If you are interested, please feel free to [navigate to our GitHub](https://github.com/echo-mods/core), we welcome issues and pull requests!

> Please not that the whole project is kind of a mess since we have very limited resources... Hopefully **you** can help with that!
